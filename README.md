# Film Release Calendar

I wanted to be able to quickly look at films coming out and add them quickly to my Google Calendar.

This repository is the front end of an app that scrapes films from the IMDB release calendar, grabs the url for the poster image for each film, and other information, displays the films posters as a grid, with a link to a new Google Calendar Event.

It is built using typescript and React. A not insignificant refactor from the previous version, but will easier to maintain, and allows dev flexibility in the future.

I'd like to have direct Google Calendar integration eventually also, most probably behind a login system.
Perhaps even a choice of calendar.
